While there are media reports concerning pets being killed in China because of fears over the spread of Covid-19, they remain unverified and have been denied by authorities.

A runny nose, sputum, dry cough and pneumonia can be symptoms of COVID-19 however not everyone infected with the disease will have them. Disease expert Prof Collingnon says temperatures around 26 to 27 degrees C won’t kill the virus however UV light from the sun can be effective in drying out the virus. Understanding of how long COVID-19 survives on surfaces is limited, with the WHO referring to previous studies of other viruses to estimate a range of a few hours to a few days. Drinking warm water, avoiding iced drinks and gargling warm salt water are not treatments or preventions, according to Prof Cunningham, however staying hydrated is important and gargling may relieve sore throats. The timeline for progression of COVID-19 symptoms is partly accurate but not everyone will experience all of these symptoms or in that order. Prof Cunningham also said it was not accurate to say infection will happen first in the throat, as the delicate tissues behind the nose are more likely starting points."

Global fatalities for HIV and Ebola are far higher, figures from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show."

The image of a supermarket shelf full of vegan foods while the shelves either side remain empty has nothing to do with the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak.

The outbreaks of SARS, Bird Flu and COVID-19 do not line up with the dates claimed in the post. In the case of Zika virus, the disease has had multiple outbreaks since 2014 in parts of Oceania and in Brazil. Bird Flu, MERS and Ebola have not been reported in Australia and have not been a significant feature of local political discussion or debate.
